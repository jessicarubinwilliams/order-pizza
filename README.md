#### By _**Jessica R. Williams**_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Bootstrap Library_
* _JavaScript_
* _jQuery Library_

## Description

_This is a an independent project for Week 1 of [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/)'s [Intermediate JavaScript Course](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript)._

_The Project Prompt:_
_Pizza Parlor_
_Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost._

* _Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order._
* _Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size._
* _Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this._
_Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes._

_The Project Objectives:_

* _Code meets standards from previous weeks._
* _Constructors and prototypes are used successfully._
* _Application works as expected._
* _Plain English specs are included in your README._
* _Required functionality is in place by the deadline._
* _Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state._
* _Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology._
_Further Exploration Option:_

* _Style your site with CSS and images._
* _Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings._
* _Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details._
* _Offer a delivery option that then requires address information._
